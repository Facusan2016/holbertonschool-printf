# _printf Project
## General information about the project

The aim of this project is to imitate the way the printf() function works, including the most used
directives as well as the ability to print some special characters.

We opted for the use of function pointers considering that it is the most efficient way of executing the different functionalities.
Approaching the project this way we consider to have the chance
of making it more scalable, being able to later add functionalities.

This project was developed by Facundo SÃ¡nchez and Facundo Villagra.
